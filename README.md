# Asynchronous Cellular Automaton (Assignment_3_Q2)

This program simulates an asynchronous cellular automaton with a one-dimensional lattice and a finite size. The automaton follows the rules of Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) and evolves over a given number of time steps.

## Description

The asynchronous cellular automaton evolves by randomly selecting a cell to update at each time step. The new state of the selected cell is determined based on its neighborhood and the ECA rule provided as input. The automaton operates on a periodic boundary condition, where the cells at the edges are connected.

# Hybrid Cellular Automaton (Assignment_3_Q3)

This program implements a hybrid cellular automaton, which is a combination of a one-dimensional cellular automaton and an ECA (Elementary Cellular Automaton). The program allows you to simulate the evolution of the automaton over multiple time steps.

## Description

The hybrid cellular automaton consists of a one-dimensional lattice of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: 0 or 1. The evolution of the automaton is governed by a set of rules, which define the state transition of each cell based on its neighborhood.

The neighborhood of a cell includes the cell itself and its two adjacent cells. The state transition rules are specified using an ECA rule table, where each rule corresponds to a unique neighborhood configuration.

The program randomly initializes the initial configuration of the automaton and applies the specified rules to evolve the automaton over multiple time steps. The resulting configurations are printed for each time step.
